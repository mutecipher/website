This is an example page. If it has a `.md.erb` file extension its contents will
be run through a Markdown parser/renderer before display. Fenced code blocks
are fully supported and will be highlighted appropriately. ERB can be used in
here. The template will be rendered **before** being parsed as Markdown. You
can can access data about the page using the `@page` variable. The title of
this page is "<%= @page.title %>".
