## ðŸ‘‹ Hey

I'm Cory. I'm a software developer out of Canada.

I like writing Ruby and recently have been getting more interested in front end development using React and Next.js.

If you're reading this, it's because apparently you were pretty eager, and found the staging environment ahead of time. Which is fine. This is really more of a place for me to just dump some stuff and make sure everything is working as intended before I merge into `main`.

### Lookbook example

> These will be broken on `staging` and `production` because I don't have a lookbook server set up. ^\_^

<div class="pb-4">
  <lookbook-embed app="http://localhost:3000/lookbook/" preview="HeaderPreview" scenario="standard"></lookbook-embed>
</div>

<lookbook-embed app="http://localhost:3000/lookbook/" preview="MemojiPreview" scenario="sizes"></lookbook-embed>
